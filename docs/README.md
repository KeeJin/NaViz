# Introduction to NaViz
NaViz is a web-based visualisation tool for robotics SLAM and navigation. It aims to provide the following:
- UI that is simple to use
- Ability to extend support for various robot adaptors (ROS, ROS2, etc)
- Feedback for common sensory data (pointcloud, imu, odometry)
- Feedback for visualising SLAM features (pose graph, factor graph, VIO keyframes, etc.)
- Feedback for visualising navigation paths and routes

> This project is currently in the design phase.

## Target Audience
The intended target audience shall be students, researchers and developers wanting to test and validate SLAM and navigation algorithms.
